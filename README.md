# Custom Printf Implementation
This Project is a custom implementation of the widely used `printf` function in the C programming language.
The goal is to create a flexible and efficient version of `printf` that supports various format specifiers,
allowing developers to easily format and print output in a controlled and user friendly manner.
By understanding the internals of `printf` from the scratch, this project aims to deepen the understanding
of string formatting, data manipulation and memory management in C programming.
